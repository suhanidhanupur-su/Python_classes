# 5. Membership Operator:-
# => Membership operators are used to test whether a sequence is presented in an object.
# => it returns True if the sequence is present in the object otherwise it returns False.


# EX: in, not in
# in Operator:-
# It returns True if the value is found in the specified sequence, otherwise it returns False.

## not in Operator:-
# It returns True if the value is not found in the specified sequence, otherwise it returns False
