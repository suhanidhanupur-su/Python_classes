# Set :- A set is a collection in Python.


#  It has the following features:
# It is unordered
# It is unindexed
# It cannot contain duplicate elements
# It stores only unique elements
# It is mutable


# Example:
# set   = {11, 22, 33, 44, 55,“Ujjwal”,“Ravi”,5.2}

# Duplicate Removal in Set
# example:
# Output
# this is actual elements of this set : {33, 11, 44, 22, 55}

# Duplicate values (11, 22, 33) were removed automatically by the set.

# Set Methods

# 1. add() – Add a Single Element
# example:

# Output
# before adding element : {33, 2, 11, 44, 22, 55}
# after adding element  : {33, 2, 11, 44, 77, 22, 55}



# 2. update() – Add Multiple Elements
# my_set = {11, 22, 33, 55, 44, 2}
# print("before adding element :", my_set)

# my_set.update({77, 999, 102})
# print("after adding element  :", my_set)


# Output
# before adding element : {33, 2, 11, 44, 22, 55}
# after adding element  : {33, 2, 102, 999, 11, 44, 77, 22, 55}



# 3. remove() – Remove a Specific Element


# Output
# before removing element : {33, 2, 11, 44, 22, 55}
# after removing element  : {33, 2, 11, 44, 55}



# Set Does NOT Support Indexing
my_set = {11, 22, 33, "rahul", "ravi", 8.8}
print("before operation :", my_set)

# print(my_set[4])   # ERROR → sets do not support indexing


# Output
# before operation : {'rahul', 33, 8.8, 11, 22, 'ravi'}


# (Attempting to access my_set[4] will raise an error.)


# Loop Through a Set
# my_set = {11, 22, 33, "rahul", "ravi", 8.8}
# print("before iteration :", my_set)

# for i in my_set:
#     print(i)


# Output
# before iteration : {'rahul', 33, 8.8, 11, 22, 'ravi'}
# rahul
# 33
# 8.8
# 11
# 22
# ravi



# Order may vary because sets are unordered.
